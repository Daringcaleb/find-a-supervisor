He is the Deputy Director, Wolv PI, and Lead CI of the prestigious EPSRC £4 million transformative healthcare technologies (2050) programme grant, along with Prof. Hussain (PI). His proposed multisensory 5G IoT-enabled audio-visual (AV) hearing aid (HA) project is ranked second in the EPSRC’s healthcare technologies grand challenge of frontiers of physical intervention. EPSRC believes that the project vision represents a step-change in how healthcare will be delivered in future. As a PI, he is leading vision 2050, which aims to leverage the complementary strengths of both the cloud-based system and internet-independent 'brain-like' on-chip MM big data processing, to enable contextual switching option in HA by 2050. \n\nAdeel is a pioneer of conscious multisensory integration (CMI) theory, which sheds light on how our brain contextually/ selectively integrates the incoming multisensory information at the cellular level. It is believed that if his introduced universal contextual field (UCF) in pyramidal cell exists, and behaves in a way he described in his work, this could be a major contribution in our understanding of the intracellular mechanisms responsible for producing coherent thoughts, percepts, and actions, which are well-adapted to different situations and long-term goals. In collaboration with Qualcomm (San Diego), Alpha Data, Oxford Computational Neuroscience, and Plymouth BRIC, he is exploring and exploiting the potential of CMI theory to realize his grand 2050 vision of future brain-inspired technologies, including energy-efficient  on-chip big data processing, novel AI tool for diagnosing neurological disorders, collaborative and trustworthy partnerships between humans and machines, and novel therapeutic interventions/ assistive technologies. \n\nHe is an electrical engineer and a cognitive scientist.

During my PhD, I developed an interest in the role of the plant cell wall in plant reproductive biology. Upon completion of my PhD, I was appointed as a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Cell Biology at the John Innes Centre, Norwich. During my time at Norwich, I performed research on the biochemistry, molecular structure and molecular biology of arabinogalactan-proteins. At this time I also developed a research interest in plant gum exudates used in the food industry (i.e. gum Arabic). Subsequent to which, I took up a post as a University Lecturer in the Botany Department at Universiti Sains Malaysia where I taught Botany and Biotechnology and continued my research on aspects of plant cell wall biology. In 1999 I returned to the U.K. and was appointed as a post-doctoral research associate in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Cambridge. At Cambridge, I carried out research in to nucleotide sugar transporters involved in cell wall biosynthesis in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. In 2001 I joined the academic staff at the University of Wolverhampton, as a Senior Lecturer in Plant Sciences and was appointed to my current post as Reader in Plant Cell Biology in 2013. During my time at Wolverhampton I have continued my research on the structure and function of the plant cell wall in a number of developmental processes and have broadened my research in to a variety of aspects of plant biology and agriculture.\n\nTo date, I have supervised six PhD students and three post-doctoral research projects to completion and am currently co-supervising four PhD students and one post-doctoral researcher.",

     "overview":"Patrick Ball graduated in Pharmacy from the University of Aston in Birmingham, UK in 1975 and became a hospital clinical pharmacist. At this time, parenteral nutrition was a rapidly developing technique and Patrick became involved virtually from the outset. In 1979 he joined a multidisciplinary nutrition support team at the Children’s Hospital in Birmingham, and over the next 14 years was involved in a number of innovations including computer applications, clinical trials, development of the team approach, control of line sepsis and occlusion and improving equipment and services for home parenteral nutrition patients. During this time he gained his Master of Science(Birmingham 1986) for a research thesis on computer applications in nutrition support. As a manager he was involved in the wider aspects of hospital pharmacy and worked to increase scholarly practice and practice research in the profession. In 1994 he left the hospitals for his first academic appointment at the University of Otago in Dunedin NZ. At the time he was working on a PhD thesis looking at the effects of dissolved oxygen in parenteral nutrition admixtures (Wales,1997) He has been involved in under and postgraduate pharmacy education and curriculum development and research for 22 years. In 2001 he was recruited to the University of Auckland where he developed a new and novel pharmacotherapy program He likes to characterise his research experience in NZ as ’the art of the possible.’ Research dollars were so scarce he would work in whatever area he was able to secure funds, so a coherent thread was difficult to maintain. In 2005 he was recruited to Charles Sturt University in Wagga Wagga NSW to become Australia’s Foundation Professor of Rural and Remote Pharmacy which quickly brought him into contact with rural health matters, the ‘top end’ of Australia and Indigenous health issues. This was further developed when he moved in 2013 to Charles Darwin University in Darwin NT. He came to the University of Wolverhampton in September 2016 and together with his co-researcher Dr Hana Morrissey has built a research base with 10 current PhD students. He is interested in both clinical and laboratory research. His clinical research is mainly looking at medication use in chronic disease management particularly in a rural context. His laboratory work is concerned with the behaviour of medications in parenteral fluid systems.",

My PhD, entitled “The Politics of Anti-Austerity in Liverpool: A More-than-Cuts Approach”, examined anti-austerity activism and alternatives to austerity in Liverpool. The research explored how austerity was being experienced, managed and contested by a wide range of societal actors including grassroots ‘anti-austerity’ campaigns, communities, third sector organisations and the city council. \n\nMore recently, my research has explored how different individuals and communities are responding to the dual processes of Brexit & COVID-19 within different field sites across England. This entails a focus on how people experience Brexit & COVID-19 with respect to their own everyday lives and the place they live as well as their wider attitudes towards social and political polarisation, inequality, immigration and multiculturalism working alongside broader media and government narratives. \n\nDrawn together, my work explores how communities in different places respond to social and political transformation. My research expertise therefore lies in identity formation, place-based politics and political contestation understood through ethnographic methodologies and participatory and co-produced research. I also have research interests in urban governance, urban regeneration, local economic development and community engagement.  \n\nThrough my research I have also worked with a diverse range of stakeholders outside of academia including neighbourhood, community and voluntary organisations, charities, political parties, third sector organisations and local authorities.",

After his BSc in Biology and MSc in Experimental Biology at University of Barcelona (Spain), he did a PhD in Genetics with Dr Elisa Marti at the Molecular Biology Institute of Barcelona. There, Jordi uncovered how the secreted protein Sonic Hedgehog coordinates the patterning, growth and differentiation of neural precursors in the vertebrate neural tube.\n\nJordi then moved to Dr Elke Ober laboratory at the MRC National Institute for Medical Research (London) in 2007. There, he studied the Eph/Ephrin pathway, a critical signalling system involved in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis and with links to cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Jordi's work revealed that bidirectional Eph/Ephrin signalling between liver precursors and the adjacent mesoderm is key for the asymmetric placement of the liver and for the correct formation of the ducts that connect the liver and the pancreas to the gut.\n\nAfter joining David Wilkinson laboratory at The Francis Crick Institute (London), Jordi investigated the role of Eph/Ephrin signalling in the formation of tissue boundaries, a critical process in embryonic development and disease. For this, he established knock- out and knock-in CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing strategies and generated null and signalling-deficient Eph/Ephrin zebrafish lines. Using these tools, he uncovered that the Eph receptor coordinates the formation of sharp borders with the acquisition of cell identities by regulating the mechanical properties of cells and activating Yap/Taz mechanotransduction.\n\nIn December 2020 Jordi joined the Faculty of Science and Engineering at University of Wolverhampton as a Senior Lecturer in Reproduction and Developmental Biology.",

I graduated from the University of Liverpool in 1995 with a BA (Hons.) in Psychology and began my PhD in the following year, securing external funding for my doctorate focussing on environmental and support related influences on the quality of life of older people with intellectual disabilities.  In 1999 I began working as a research fellow in a joint post between the Institute of Health and Wellbeing at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) and the Manchester Learning Disability Partnership working with practitioners to conduct research to evaluate the effects of communication and health interventions on the wellbeing of people using learning disability services.  I completed my PhD in 2002. In the same year I became a lecturer and subsequently a senior lecturer in psychology at MMU where I remained until Spring 2009. I then moved to Ireland to work on two national research projects at the National Institute for Intellectual Disabilities at Trinity College Dublin.

     "overview":"Career Path and Research History\n\nDuring my PhD at Massey University, in New Zealand, I worked in the group of Andrew Sutherland-Smith. I collaborated with Otago medical school, combining clinical work with bone disorder patients and the genetics of the families (from the collaborators), and biochemistry, cell biology and structural biology (from my work). In 2009, after my PhD, I moved to the UK, to Birkbeck, within the group of Christine Slingsby. Here, I used both crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (CryoEM) methods, to determine the structures of small heat shock proteins. I processed heterogeneous cryoEM datasets using 2D image classification, and performed 3D reconstructions using the IMAGIC-5 software, in a collaboration with Elena Orlova. Following this, I moved to the group of Paula da Fonseca, in the MRC-LMB in Cambridge. Here my aim was to solve the structure of the 26S proteasome by CryoEM. I used the Thermo-Fisher Titan Krios microscope, to collect high-resolution data sets then used advanced image processing methods using the RELION software, in collaboration with Sjors Scheres' group, I was able to solve a number of biologically relevant conformations of the 26S proteasome, with the highest reaching a uniform 4.1A resolution. Following this, I worked as an annotator at the Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe.org). In 2018 I moved to University of Wolverhampton to take a post as a biochemistry lecturer.\n\n \nResearch Collaborators\n\nDr. Christos Savva, Leicester Institute of Structural and Chemical Biology, University of Leicester\n\nDr. Marta Carroni, SciLifeLab (a joint institute between Stockholm University, Karolinska Institutet, KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Uppsala University)",

     "overview":"My interests in human behaviour and wellbeing led me to train in Psychology at Bangor University. I specialised in cognitive psychology and neurodevelopment, researching differences in cognitive performance in mono- and bi-lingual children. Following a part time role working on a clinical trials unit I returned to complete an MSc in Psychological Research and used experimental neuroimaging to apply a theory to mirror system development (Wiggett et al., Soc Neurosci, 2012). I pursued a PhD in cognitive psychology at Loughborough University through a university-awarded studentship. My research investigated mediating and moderating factors on the effect of physical activity on the development of dementia through analysis of a large cohort data set and a randomised controlled trial (https://bit.ly/32jpUEM). Towards the end of my PhD I began working as a research assistant at the University of Wolverhampton researching epidemiology of dementia, publishing a number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses under a Bupa Foundation-funded project. I have since led and worked on a number of funding applications to different types of funders. I have managed consultancy projects with external partners including an evaluation of a veterans housing scheme in Wolverhampton funded by Forces in Mind Trust (report available at https://bit.ly/2GAQVfn), as well as working on my own research projects (e.g. Early Researcher Award Scheme project around dementia caregivers; https://bit.ly/2vaSHiE).",

Then the details of EA2010, what it covers, and how it was changed to include a reference to caste is explained. Implications of the 'duty' to add caste as an aspect of race are explained. She explains the stalemate in March 2017, when government's promised public consultation on the secondary legislation on caste in Great Britain had not yet commenced. Manohar Birdi of Lotus TV is interviewing her. She refers to her reports on Caste in Britain for the UK Equality and Human Rights Commission and points out common misunderstandings of the workings of the EA2010 which partly explain the opposition from some quarters to the addition of caste as an aspect of race in the EA2010. She mentions several community reports cataloguing incidences of caste discrimination in Britain and informs that the government (on 12 March 2017) had failed to release its own commissioned Feasibility Study to measure caste discrimination. She argues that caste discrimination should not be seen as an issue for a particular religion or particular communities, but it must be universally seen as a human rights issue concerning everyone. Manohar Birdi asks what practically can be done. Meena suggests preparedness for the public consultation, deep thinking about ways of building solidarity and using all available means of sharing experiences.",

     "overview":"My current research interests, publications as well as editorial work focus upon issues of the relationship between language/discourse/ and society and social identities, and in particular on ethnographic and discursive aspects of lived experience of post-communism as well as post-89 and post-enlargement migration. I've been collecting migrants’ narratives recounting experiences of moving country and researching on-line media and internet forum discourses in relation to post-04 migration from Poland. My new project BRAD Brexit and Deportations: Towards a comprehensive and transnational understanding of a new system targeting EU Citizens under H2020-MSCA-IF scheme is devoted to the topic of media and individual discourse of Brexit and migration. Earlier, after I graduated from the Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland (MA in Polish Philology and MA in Social Anthropology), I was involved in a major government-funded linguistic project into Polish place names. In my doctoral dissertation I approached names as cultural texts mapping out cultural realities of their users. I became interested in the analysis of naturally occurring discourses while working on a large study of discursive construction of identities in European border communities funded by the European Commission (FP5).\n\nI am available for postgraduate research supervision in the following areas: post-enlargement migration; netnography and internet; narrative and identity; discourse and (social) change",

The focus of his teaching and research is modern British history, primarily using the themes of medicine, charity and welfare to explore wider questions of gender, citizenship and consumerism.\n\nHis most recent book, ‘Payment and Philanthropy in British Healthcare, 1918-48’ (MUP 2017), explored the complex meanings of payment in the pre-NHS hospital. It argues that, when patient payments became commonplace after the First World War, they neither empowered consumers as hoped nor crowded out the sick poor as feared, instead they found a surprisingly traditional accommodation with the long-established class-bound principles of philanthropy. \n\nHe is currently working on two books. One is a history of charity-run shops, drawing attention to vast number of historic retail operations with aims other than fundraising. The other is a collection co-edited with Dr Grace Millar on 'retail and community in modern Britain', with each chapter exploring case studies in the impact of family, community and social relations on retail and shopkeeping in recent centuries. \n\nHe is also currently working on a number of journal articles on the history of British charities adopting commercial practices, the training and support of blind veterans as craftsmen and shopkeepers after the First World War, and the different pedagogical approaches to introducing university students to historical research in archives.\n\nAt some point he plans to return to the history of the NHS and specifically the boundaries and meanings of the NHS as a 'free' health service, providing insights into demonetised citizenship in the British postwar welfare state.",

I have extensive experience in developing commercial Natural Language Processing (NLP) vertical solutions. I have acted as an acting coordinator of an EU Leonardo project (TELLME) which developed a range of products including work-related language exercises, showcasing NLP technologies such as automatic term extraction and MCQ generation. I have developed a Computer-Aided Patient Notes Scoring System for a well-known US medical examiners organisation. I have been leading research activities in the domain of applying NLP technologies for licensing testing, funded by an US organization on a yearly rolling research contract, including American-British transliteration, information extraction, item difficulty prediction, item response time prediction, and item distractor prediction. I have experiences on utilizing eye tracking data for various tasks.

I work to provide an outstanding research culture for our PhD, Professional Doctorate and MPhil research students — one that supports expanded access, transparency of assessment, vibrant research communities, skills and career development, and timely completions. I see my role as exclusively working for the research student experience, across all disciplines in the University, and across all aspects of the student journey and well-being. In the Postgraduate Experience Survey (PRES) of 2021, the University of Wolverhampton was placed an overall 5th in the UK for \"Research Culture\", 11th for professional development and 12th for satisfaction with supervision, and with some disciplinary areas coming 1st in the UK. The university led one of the thirteen UK networks awarded funding by the Office for Students in 2021 to enact a step-change in access to postgraduate research for historically marginalised groups (funding awarded: £798,667).\n\nI have had two monographs published in the area of Film Studies / Film History:\n• \"Michael Reeves\" from Manchester University Press (2003; second edition 2012)\n• \"Desires for Reality: Radicalism and Revolution in Western European Film\" from Berghahn (2016)\n\nA third monograph, \"Hotbeds of Licentiousness: The British Glamour Film and the Permissive Society\", is now at press for publication by Berghahn in 2022. \n\nI have co-edited seven books, covering music and media, political philosophy and activism, and noise:\n• \"Mark E. Smith and The Fall: Art, Music and Politics\", Ashgate, 2010, with Michael Goddard\n• \"Reverberations: The Philosophy, Aesthetics and Politics of Noise\", Continuum, 2012, with Michael Goddard and Paul Hegarty\n• \"Resonances: Noise and Contemporary Music\", Bloomsbury Academic, 2013, with Michael Goddard and Nicola Spelman\n• \"The Music Documentary: Acid Rock to Electropop\", Routledge, 2013, with Kirsty Fairclough-Isaacs and Robert Edgar\n• \"The Arena Concert: Music, Media and Mass Entertainment\", Bloomsbury, 2015, with Kirsty Fairclough-Isaacs, Robert Edgar and Nicola Spelman\n• \"Stories We Could Tell: Putting Words to American Popular Music\", by David Sanjek, Routledge, 2019, posthumously co-edited with Tom Attah and Mark Duffett.\n• \"Politics of the Many: Contemporary Radical Thought and the Crisis of Agency\", Bloomsbury Academic, 2021, with Rebecca Carson, Stefano Pippa and Alexei Penzin \n\nAnd, forthcoming for publication in 2022, are the co-edited collections:\n• \"Diva: Feminism and Fierceness from Pop to Hip-Hop\", Bloomsbury Academic, with Shara Rambarran, Kirsty Fairclough and Nicole Hodges Persley\n• \"Adult Themes: British Cinema and the X-Rating, 1958-1972\", Bloomsbury Academic, with Christopher Weedman and Anne Etienne\n\nMy journal articles have appeared in TDR, Framework, Theory & Event, Cultural Politics, New Review of Film and Television Studies, Slovo, and Studies in East European Cinema. I’ve presented papers at academic conferences and film festivals in several countries, overseen and curated film retrospectives, and served on the jury of the Leeds International Film Festival. I’ve introduced and talked about the films of Michael Reeves around the world, and appeared in related documentaries. I peer review for a variety of journals and publishers, including Oxford University Press, Routledge, Bloomsbury, Palgrave and Manchester University Press. I was returned to the Research Assessment Exercise in 2008, and the Research Excellence Framework in 2014 and 2021 (the latter on behalf of both the University of Salford, and Wolverhampton, with outputs in different units of assessment respectively).\n\nI previously worked at the universities of Aberystwyth (1994-2001), York St John (2001-2007) and Salford (2007-2015). At the latter institution I was Director of Postgraduate Research Studies for the College of Arts and Social Sciences. I completed my MPhil and PhD (supervised by Prof Ioan Williams) at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, where I worked closely with John Hefin MBE (former Head of Drama, BBC Wales) and Prof Dame Elan Closs Stephens CBE (former Chair of the S4C Authority) in establishing and running a new degree in Film and Television Studies in 1997. I also co-founded (and named) the annual Ffresh Film Festival. I was involved in the bid preparation, formation and running of the North West Consortium Doctoral Training Partnership, across seven Higher Education institutions, which was awarded £14 million by the Arts and Humanities Research Council in 2014.\n\nFor details and downloads of my academic publications since 1998, please see: https://benjaminhalligan.com/\nemail: b.halligan[at]wlv.ac.uk",

     "overview":"In my practice orientated PhD, which centred on painting, the cinematic and a re-negotiation of formalist modes of painting practice through an exploration of Gilles Deleuze’s philosophical processes. Specifically, how their philosophical relationship to the virtual could inform each other towards a concept of the painted picture plane that acknowledged both surface and pictorial depth. A central premise of the research both theoretically and practically, as a studio investigation, explored the potential of the internal pictorial plane becoming a virtual, complex and a plural space with a duration more akin to celluloid and the cinematic. Giles Deleuze’s concept of ‘‘the fold’ and ‘duration’ were at the core of the research and provided a method to re-think the established Renaissance, Modernist and Post-Modernist pictorial planes. The research discussed my own studio practice as it explored these concepts.\n\nMy continued research is has taken the relationship between the photographic darkroom as a point of the abstracted event for painting. It is at this point of nexus that the distinct relationship between painting, photography and ‘the virtual’ can be presented. In effect how, an understanding of the virtual can be employed as a mode of post-digital semblance (representation). The role of the virtual becomes a key concept in understanding how as a mode of visual semblance as a constructed illusion becomes pictorially abstract through the advent of the post-digital.",

     "overview":"John Wood and Paul Harrison \t\t\n\nJohn Wood and Paul Harrison make single-channel videos, multi-screen video installations, prints, drawings, and sculptures that elegantly fuse advanced aesthetic research with existential comedy. The artists’ spare, to-the-point works feature the actions of their own bodies, a wide variety of static and moving props, or combinations of both to illustrate the triumphs and tribulations of making art and having a life. The videos maintain a strict internal logic, with the action directly related to the duration of the work. Inside this 'logical world' action is allowed to happen for no apparent reason, tensions build between the environment and its inhabitant, play is encouraged and the influences on the work are intentionally mixed. In their not-always- successful experiments with movement and materials, many of which critic Tom Lubbock has described as “sculptural pratfalls,” Wood and Harrison employ exuberant invention, subtle slapstick, and a touch of light-hearted melancholy to reveal the inspiration and perspiration — as well as the occasional hint of desperation — behind all creative acts. \n\nJohn Wood (b.1969, Hong Kong) and Paul Harrison (b.1966, Wolverhampton) met in 1989 at the Bath College of Higher Education, and have worked together since 1993.",

I have extensive experience in work on anti-racist pedagogy, much of her work focuses on classroom interaction, engagement, student group dialogue and staff to student discussions. I am particularly concerned with  BaME student experiences, in particular their poorer progression and attainment rates in HE.  In this work I argues that the teaching and learning experience of students are related to issues of identity and diversity that informs transformation and success. \nMy research is grounded in BAME student experiences of HE and the findings underpin my teaching and pedagogic practice. Recent literature by both the NUS and HEA notes the importance of institutions centering BAME voice and experience in the development of institutional strategies to tackle this issue. Through my teaching and research, I have established a national reputation as an expert in the field of anti-racist education and critical pedagogy in Higher Education in the UK. I have published extensively in peer reviewed journals and books (see attached C.V.) My PhD was achieved by publication.

My interest quickly turned into passion when I discovered that little work has been done on alcohol abuse in the Panjabi Sikh community. \n\nFollowing completion of this research project, I hope to forge further opportunities to engage with alcohol abuse and other public health areas in the Panjabi Sikh community.

     "overview":"I am a perpetual student, having begun my university career with the Open University in 1998. I am now a PhD candidate at the University of Wolverhampton examining aspects of the First World War in my home town of Barnsley, South Yorkshire.\n\nI previously worked at Sheffield Hallam University in Student Records and Systems Management. This provided me with technical and administrative skills which are directly transferable to my research. I was part of the team which presented training on the various IT systems in the University to new and continuing members of staff, and following my reluctant early retirement took a PGCE in Teaching IT to the Elderly with placements teaching with AgeUK and the Barnsley Council's Adult Learning programme. Sadly my ill health prevented me from being able to continue this as a career change, however I did spend a number of years travelling to various schools and community groups, on an occasional basis, speaking on local and family history and latterly the history of the First World War. \n\nDuring the Centenary of the First World War I was part of a voluntary project, the Barnsley War Memorials Project, which aimed to seek out and record all the war memorials in the Barnsley area. I was the Secretary of the Project and the first webmaster, responsible for the creation of a website using Blogger software which would make our findings available to the general public. At the close of the project in 2019, myself and one other committee member took over the administration of website and continue improving it to the present day. I also managed the projects to transcribe the 1918 Absent Voters List for Barnsley, and the indexing of the local newspaper, the Barnsley Chronicle, from August 1914 to March 1919, for every mention of a serviceman, woman or civilian war worker. This involved providing batches of work to volunteers who undertook the tasks in their own homes, collating and checking the completed batches, and preparing the transcriptions for printing and digital presentation.  These transcriptions and indexes are available at Barnsley Archives and online.\n\nMy aim is to make the history of the First World War as it concerned Barnsley, and knowledge of the ways in which communities in the Barnsley area commemorated and remembered their servicemen and women, much more widely available to the general public of Barnsley. One way of achieving this has been to create a Public Facebook Group called Barnsley's History - The Great War which now has over 1.2k members. Posts are made daily and experienced members (local historians, battlefield specialists, military historians) respond to questions submitted by members. Members post their own photographs and family stories which help to create an interactive local online community.\n\nThe Barnsley & District War Memorials website and the Barnsley's History - The Great War Facebook group are registered as one entity with the Community Archives and Heritage Group.",

     "overview":"Dr Karan Jutlla is the Dementia Lead for the Institute of Health at the University of Wolverhampton. Her specialist role is designed to provide leadership for the development and delivery of dementia care curricula and research, promoting the development of a culturally competent healthcare workforce skilled in dementia care. \n\nKaran graduated from the University of Salford in 2006 with a First Class Honours degree in Health Sciences. During her final year she conducted research for Dementia UK (then known as Fordementiaplus) exploring South Asian carers’ experiences of services in Wolverhampton when caring for a family member with dementia. This research led to her doctoral study at Keele University which explored how migration experiences impact upon caring for a person with dementia in the Sikh community in Wolverhampton. This biographical study highlighted challenges with access to, and experience of, health and social care services in the UK – with such experiences being strongly linked to their experiences as migrants in the UK. \n\nIn 2010, she became a Senior Lecturer in Dementia Studies at the University of Worcester developing bespoke dementia education programmes to support services to be culturally competent via a person-centred approach to dementia care. This work included working with one of the leading and largest social care organisations in the UK to support their service to become culturally inclusive and enable them to provide effective work in cross-cultural situations. In 2015, she joined the School of Nursing and Midwifery at De Montfort University in Leicester to further develop cultural competency training and dementia care in education and research. In 2016, she was appointed the Dementia Lead for the School of Nursing and Midwifery at De Montfort University which involved ensuring the nursing curriculum and research agenda are reflective of local and regional challenges in dementia care. In 2018, she worked with Compton Care as a Senior Research Associate on a project which investigated the views and experiences of the South Asian community in Wolverhampton when living with and caring for someone, with a complex and incurable condition. In 2019, she was appointed the Dementia Lead for the University of Wolverhampton. She joined the University of Wolverhampton in June 2019 as the Dementia Lead for the Institute of Health. \n\nAs a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy, Karan has extensive experience of developing and delivering training and education programmes to support healthcare professionals and services to be culturally competent via a person-centred approach. Part of her education and training also involves understanding neurological impairment in dementia and how cognitive ability can be supported for such people. Karan is a strong believer that ‘dementia is not the death that leaves the body behind’ and that people with dementia can be supported to live well via creativity. Karan is also a professional dancer and is the co-founder of Eclectic Dancers. Her passion for dance and appreciation of the arts allows her to both combine and support creativity for improved mental health and wellbeing.\n\nFor more information about Karan, visit: www.drjutlla.com",

     "overview":"Dean Kelland is a UK Based Artist who explores portraiture as a performative practice. His process follows an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates performance film, live performance techniques and photography as well as other media and methods. \n\nDean completed his PhD at Central St Martins. His doctoral thesis “Flawed Masculinities: \"Rupturing\" 1950s/60s/70s British Sitcom via a Performance-led Interdisciplinary Arts Practice” was supervised by Professor Roger Sabin, Reader Susan Trangmar and Jane Gibb at Central St Martins, and was successfully examined by Dr. Simon Grennan (University of Chester) and Professor Caroline Evans (Central St Martins).\n\nBorn in 1973 in the Great Barr suburb of Birmingham, his formative years coincided with the “golden age” of the sit-com and an opportunity to view repeated episodes of comedies such as “Hancock's Half Hour”, “Steptoe & Son” and “Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads?”. As one of the second city’s most celebrated comedy icons the character of Hancock helped shape Dean’s experiences and at a relatively early age he developed an interest in British comedy. This lead onto a growing interest in British Comedians such as Les Dawson, Tommy Cooper and Frankie Howerd.\n\n In 1997 Dean graduated from the University of Wolverhampton with a First Class Honours Degree in Photography. Following a period of time successfully pursuing a career as a lecturer within art & design he consolidated his practical experiences by completing a Masters degree in Fine Art at Staffordshire University in 2006. It is within his PhD research project that Dean has undertaken a more autobiographical approach to the inception of projects and has returned to the themes of comedy that were so prevalent in shaping him during his formative years.\n\nHaving shown work at a variety of locations throughout the UK, Dean has secured solo exhibitions at the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham and was also commissioned to produce new work for the international video art exhibition alongside artists such as Gillian Wearing, Cornelia Parker and Beat Streuli for About Town in conjunction with Birmingham Hippodrome Plus and Ikon. He has also presented work on Hancock’s Half Hour and Steptoe and Son as part of the With Humorous Intent Symposium at the Mostyn Oriel Gallery in Llandudno and the annual British Comedy Conference at Manchester Metropolitan University. Dean has also been featured in Re-framing Photography and a recent edition of the Comedy Studies Journal.\n\nIn 2018 he became Artist in Residence at the Birmingham & Midland Institute. The  work continued his interest in performance and comedy with developments leading toward practical investigations surrounding Slapstick, Comedy & Pain. The resulting work was shown as part of the \"Floating Worlds\" Exhibition for Ikon Gallery for the Ruya Foundation in Baghdad and ArtBab in Bahrain as well as the international Flatpack Film Festival.\n\nDean has just been announced as the new Artist in Residence at HMP Grendon for Ikon Gallery and the Marie Louise Von Motescizky Trust. The Artist in Residence at HMP Grendon provides a unique opportunity to draw together a number of partner organisations within contemporary art to contribute research to, for and with the University of Wolverhampton. \n\nAt the conclusion of the residency there is an exhibition at Ikon with a series of publications, seminars, learning socials, educational events (Criminal Justice and Prison Education). Prison education and particularly models of education from the creative industries is a growing concern in terms of its impact on positive change and contribution to rehabilitation. The arts are practiced within the criminal justice system in many different ways. They take place in education classes within the prison system, via innovative voluntary sector organisations and are self-practiced with extraordinary results. Dean will be Artist in Residence for at HMP Grendon for 3 years.",

     "overview":"I have specific research interest in 3 main themes - decision-making, behavioural change and sustainability. My research aims to create positive attitudes and sustainable behavioural change to reduce public health burden – in health and non-health related conditions. I have managed and researched in many areas: quality of care and services, awareness, knowledge, help-seeking and decision-making, psycho-social aspects of disease/condition, willingness to pay and online cancer information - in various health settings (primary, secondary, tertiary, and community), disease conditions and multicultural setting.  I have used several methodologies such as in systematic review and health technologies assessment, mixed methods research design, quasi-RCT, case-control studies, public health intervention evaluation, economic studies, and ethnographic methods. My extensive research and public health academic experience have helped understand the benefit of combining different methods and theoretical paradigms. My current work is focusing on - (1) enabling and empowering decision-making and coping among people with mild dementia through appropriate design, and emotional eating among children; (2) promoting sustainable environmental behaviour and practices through education using a peer2peer approach; (3) prevalence of oral cancer in Bangladesh; and (4) human ecology and prevention of public health burden due to built environment.",

I went on to do a PhD in Neuropsychological Rehabilitation at the University of Birmingham, in which I investigated route-learning techniques for people with acquired brain injuries, using non-immersive virtual reality software.\n\nIn 2007, I returned to Oxford University where I worked as a postdoctoral researcher, and then as a senior postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Psychiatry. There I carried out large scale web-based surveys of online gamblers, investigating problem gambling, motivations for gambling, comorbid mood and substance use disorders, and participation in other online activities. In 2013, I moved to the Nuffield Department of Population Health at Oxford University, where I worked on a qualitative study of treatment outcomes in schizophrenia. I worked as a Psychology Lecturer at Staffordshire University from 2014-2017, where I continued my research into gambling behaviour, branching out to begin exploring the links between gambling and gaming. \n\nI moved to Wolverhampton University in 2017 to join the Cyberpsychology Research Group, and take up a role as lecturer in Cyberpsychology. Since moving to Wolverhampton I have continued researching the links between gaming and gambling, leading a research project funded by GambleAware, investigating loot box purchasing. I have also begun work on a Facebook-funded study exploring the factors associated with online sharing of extreme violent content.

Adopting the ideas of intersectionality allows people to find themselves in multiple spaces and use those spaces to rewrite narrative previously written for them by others without any incline of what goes on under our very essence. Everyone deserves the power, right and opportunity to rewrite their narratives. Everyone deserves a chance at individuality.\n\nI am passionate about creating safe, intersectional, spaces because being a black woman of low socioeconomic status and an immigrant.

     "overview":"Eva is a passionate scientist and an inspiring educator. With a passion for research and wide span of interests, her area of expertise defies easy compartmentalisation, and the multidisciplinary approach she has developed sets her apart from her computer science peer group. Her natural inclination is to open new pathways rather than re-tread old ones. She has an acknowledged ability to build new areas of research from scratch, identify key problems and raise questions that have not been voiced before. She approaches the answers in an original way by transferring ideas from one field to another. Few computer scientists can credibly claim to have controlled walking robots, eliminated mechanical vibration in oil fields, introduced formal methods of computer science into dynamical systems theory, and modelled important aspects of the human brain to create a new theory of neuroplasticity with the potential to radically change the study of the brain and neuromorphic computing.\n\nEva is a scientist of international standing in hybrid dynamical systems, cyber-physical systems, network science, mathematical modelling, simulation, automated verification and reasoning, formal methods of computer science, symbolic artificial intelligence (AI), automation, control engineering, robotics, stability of dynamical systems, evolution of complex systems, self-organisation, advanced algorithms, computational neuroscience, neuro-inspired computing, data science and collective intelligence. \n\nEva has developed her career in industry and academia in three different countries: Mexico, the UK and Spain. She shadowed the footsteps of Alan Turing in Manchester, 2008-2020, and Santiago Ramón y Cajal in Madrid, 2016-17. She is one of the world's experts in Turing's morphogenesis –having collaborated with the last Alan Turing’s student. She is currently proposing new models of computation, learning and evolution for complex systems as a Reader in Data Science and Director and founder of AiDAs, the Artificial intelligence and DAta science Research Lab at the School of Mathematics and Computer Science in the University of Wolverhampton. She is also modelling important aspects of the human brain. Embedded within the nascent field of cyber-physical social systems, she is also a Honorary Senior Research Fellow of the Spatial Policy Lab of the Manchester Urban Institute and the School of Environment, Education and Development at The University of Manchester, where she applies network and data science to analyse social and urban dynamics. Moreover, she is part of the core team of AI Mexico, which promotes artificial intelligence (AI) education and its responsible adoption by industry. AI Mexico is the coordinating institution of the Coalition IA2030Mx, a key coalition for the National Agenda for AI of Mexico. \n\nEva is one of the 7 founders of ACM-Women Europe  (the Association for Computing Machinery’s Council on Women in Computing in Europe) and the founder of the ACM womENcourage conference series in Europe. She is also a member of the UNESCO Inclusive Policy Lab, member of the British Computer Society (BCS) Women in Computing Research Committee of the BCS Academy of Computing.  She has recently joined Technolatinas, a community to bring together technologists and scientists from Latin America and all around the world to support each other and advocate for equality, diversity and inclusion. In Wolverhampton, she is continuing her work on equality, inclusion and diversity as the Chair of the new Athena Swan Task Force Group within the School of Mathematics and Computer Science. \n\nEva is also a lover of philosophy, arts, music and poetry.",

Approximately six further new species descriptions are currently in preparation. In 2018 a new Asian pipesnake was described by German colleagues with the patronym Cylindrophis osheai.\n\nI have worked on a number of snakebite projects, in Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, as a specialist experienced with capturing and milking medically important venomous snakes, working with clinicians from the Universities of Oxford, Melbourne and Adelaide, and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. I am on the WHO Roster of Snakebite Experts.  I also have experience of snakebite from the victim's point of view, having been hospitalised with serious snakebites on several occasions.\n\nI held the posts of first Curator of Reptiles, and then Consultant Curator of Reptiles, at West Midland Safari Park for a total of 33 years (1987-2019 inclusive) and accomplished first UK breedings for the endangered Aruba Island Rattlesnake (Crotalus unicolor) and Ornate Cantil (Agkistrodon taylori).\n\nI have authored seven books, including \"A Book of Snakes: A life-size guide to six hundred species from around the world\" (2018) and Lizards of the World (2021), and  am working on a slow burn revision of my field guide to the snakes of New Guinea.\n\nI have also presented around forty adventurous natural history documentaries for Discovery, Animal Planet, Channel 4, BBC & ITV, including my own international television series on Animal Planet for five years (1999-2003), known as \"O'Shea's Big Adventure\" (AP) or \"O'Shea's Dangerous Reptiles\" (C4).\n\nI am frequently invited to speak at conferences, symposia and herpetological meetings. I have presented my work orally or as a poster in the following countries: United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, Spain, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Australia, Papua New Guinea, United States, Mexico, Costa Rica, and Brazil.\n\nI am a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, Linnean Society of London, and Explorers' Club of New York. I was awarded one of only eight Millennium Awards for Services to Exploration, by the British Chaper of the Explorers' Club in 2000 and an Honorary Doctor of Sciences degree, for services to herpetology, by the University of Wolverhampton in 2001. In 2015 Czech herpetologists voted me \"Snakeman of the Year\".\n\nI became Professor of Herpetology at the University of Wolverhampton in September 2018.\nI received an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours in October 2020 but the award ceremony was delayed because of Covid. The award was for services to High Education, Zoology, Reptile Conservation and Snakebite Research. I finally received the award from Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, at an investiture at Windsor Castle on 30 November 2021.",

His current duties include the supervision of PhD students: Mireille Makary (now completed)  is working on a topic on search engine evaluation, the automatic generation of test collections; Najah Albaqawi is working on a corpus of Gulf Pidgin Arabic; and Ahmed Omer is working on Arabic stylometry. He is the course leader for the MA programme in Computational Linguistics at the University of Wolverhampton, and teaches modules on Computational Linguistics and Corpus Linguistics.  He was appointed to the post in 2013, having previously worked for 13 years as a Senior Lecturer in Computing at the University of Sunderland. He was the Principal Investigator at Sunderland for the EU-funded VITALAS project (http://vitalas.ercim.eu), which was rated excellent in the final report by the external evaluators. Dr. Oakes’ doctoral thesis was in the area of information retrieval, and he has successfully acted as the main supervisor for seven doctoral students of his own in this area.   He has also produced over 80 refereed publications: 11 journal articles, 2 books as sole author, 10 book chapters and 58 conference papers. He has a long standing interest in studies of disputed authorship. He worked with Dr. Alois Pichler at the Wittgenstein Archives in Bergen to look at works thought to have been dictated by Wittgenstein. With the late Dr. Harry Erwin he used the multivariate technique of correspondence analysis to examine evidence for a Signs Gospel, a possible precursor of the Gospel of St. John. His most recent book, “Literary Detective Work on the Computer” (2104) was published by John Benjamins, and included chapters on disputed authorship, plagiarism and spam, stylometry (computer studies of the writing style) of Shakespeare and religious texts, and they ways in which computers can help to decipher lost languages. More recently he has worked on a statistical analysis of the Indus script, and a computer analysis of the provenance of \"The Dark Tower\" by C.S. Lewis. He is writing the chapter on “Disputed Authorship, Stylometry and Spam” for the next edition of the “Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics”. A new book co-edited with Meng Ji will come out shortly, entitled \"Advances in Empirical Translation Studies\".",

He has offered consultancy advise for various civil and structural engineering projects worth over £100million.\n\nHe facilitated training on various aspects of Construction Health and Safety and Electronic Project Management. As an off-shoot of the work, several Journal Papers focused on enhancing the development of practitioners' knowledge of Construction Health and Safety Practice were published in the Journal of Education in the Built Environment.\n\nFurthermore, three PhD students were also commissioned to work on Accident Prevention, Competence Assessment and Cost-Benefits of Health and Safety Programme Implementation between 2003 and 2009 out of which several Journal publications were completed and further research work was commissioned. Such publications included those in the: International Journal of Safety, ASCE Journal of Construction Engineering and International Journal of IT in Construction (IT-CON) amongst others. Outcome of these programmes were all also published in the Construction Industry Board (CIB) Health and Safety Research Round up. Other similar PhDs had since been delivered including Health and Safety in Lean Construction and others between 2010 and 2013 with a wide ranging Journal and Conference publications.He has sice supervised a wider range of Built Environment PhDs with several publications accompanying the projects\n\nHe has also been a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers' (ICE) Health and Safety Expert Panel and the Health and Safety Register from 2005 till Date and further serves as a Reviewer for intending Registrants (chartered civil engineers). His work with the ICE allowed him to be engaged as a chapter author and co-editor of the ICE Construction Health and Safety Manual which was published in June 2010. The second Edition has also been published since 2015. His research interests continue to span a wide range of built environment sustainability themes and is engaging more with industrial collaborators and institutions across Europe and the rest of the world.",

     "overview":"I am a Senior Lecturer in Philosophy.\n\nMy main area of research is ethics. I am particularly interested in both theoretical and applied issues related to human evil, the ethics of forgiveness and, more recently, the ethics of memory, including related themes in political philosophy (i.e. political forgiveness, commemoration, punishment and conflict resolution). \n\nI also have a longstanding interest in the history of ethics (i.e. Aristotle, Spinoza and Kant) and the intersection of ethics with philosophy of mind (i.e. moral psychology, motivation, practical rationality and the emotions) and with aesthetics (i.e. political and moral engagement in art).\n\nMy current research has two strands. In various recent articles, I have been developing a Kantian approach to forgiveness, exploring the relationship between forgiveness, moral development, justice and self-respect. Beyond Kant, my research in this area is informed by the experience of conflict in Argentina where I reflect philosophically on the Argentine victims’ refusal to forgive and forget, drawing from  contemporary literature in philosophy and other disciplines (history, psychology and anthropology). \n\nI have recently co-edited (with Krisanna Scheiter from Union College New York) a volume on  Conflict and Resolution- The Ethics of Forgiveness, Revenge and Punishment (forthcoming with Springer). I am contributing a sole-authored chapter entitled \"Remembrance beyond Forgiveness\" and I have co-written the introduction with Krisanna. \n\nI love Spinoza but I am convinced I ought to be a Kantian. \n\nI am also a mum of two very active and energetic young boys. When I am not reading, writing and/ or teaching philosophy, I love to draw. \n\nBiography\n\nI studied philosophy at The University of Buenos Aires where I graduated with a thesis on Aristotle’s Eudemian Ethics under the supervision of Osvaldo Guariglia. An Overseas Research Scholarship enabled me to study for a PhD at The University of Manchester. My PhD thesis was entitled Kant’s Theory of Motivation and Rational Agency and was supervised by Harry Lesser, Anthony Hatzimoysis and Graham Stevens. Before arriving to Wolverhampton in 2019, I lectured at the University of Manchester (2016-2019), Durham University (2014-16), Keele University (2013-14), the Open University (2010-14) and Bolton University (2006-08).",

He leads on English modules for both undergraduate and postgraduate primary teaching courses leading to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), and also teaches on the Masters in Education programme. He has been nominated by students for a Vice Chancellor's Award for Staff Excellence in the 'Enriching the Learning Experience' and 'Student Engagement' categories eight times in the past three years.\n\nA Senior Fellow of the Higher Education Academy, Matt’s doctoral thesis focused on the epistemological and pedagogical trajectories of PGCE trainees within the field of Primary English. Matt’s research interests have previously focused on personalising the learning journey for children and students, but he is now predominantly working on mobile and digital learning, particularly in the Globalised South; digital literacy; the use of social media for public health benefits; and school children as leaders of public health movements. He recently co-authored a report for the Department for International Development's EdTech Hub on lessons learned to support governments' digital responses to the educational crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. With John Traxler, Matt has co-edited a Elgar Publications book (coming out in summer 2022) charting the effects of the pandemic on digital learning across the Higher Education sector.\n\nMatt is involved in research in Palestine focusing on developing mobile technologies for supporting the teaching of English; in Wolverhampton focusing on mental health and resilience in young people; in Brazil, supporting school populations to influence virus control through mobile applications; and is Principal Investigator on an Erasmus+ project with partners across Europe creating a new online collaborative approach to textbook work. He is also currently involved in bidding for projects in Mexico, Brazil, India, Kazakhstan and in the EU.\n\nPrior to becoming a Senior Lecturer, Matt worked as a primary teacher, English specialist and Assistant Headteacher. He is keen for children to take ownership of their learning, and to work with teachers to develop a facilitative, learner-centric method that favours exploration and social construction of learning over more traditional, didactic teaching styles.\n\nMatt teaches two modules on the Masters in Education programme, and supervises both Masters and Doctoral thesis students. He currently has six PhD and EdD students, and is very proud of his first completing student, who successfully defended her viva in June 2020.",

     "overview":"I am a Senior Lecturer in Biomechanics at the University of Wolverhampton, having formally held academic positions at the University of Hull and University of Roehampton. I hold a PhD in sports biomechanics from Southern Cross University (Australia) and a BSc (Hons) in Sport Science from the University of Brighton.\n\nMy research interests are linked to the biomechanics of health, exercise and sport. In the area of health and exercise I am interested in the biomechanics of functional movement and activities of daily living in differing populations (especially neurological, sedentary and obese), and the use of biomechanically derived feedback and exercise interventions to improve musculo-skeletal health and functional performance at everyday tasks. Within sport my main interests include the biomechanics of sports performance, especially football, and the application of biomechanics to the coaching / training environment.\n\nI have been a recipient of the University of Wolverhampton, Early Researcher Award Scheme Fellowship, which focused on the mechanics of bone health and functional performance in sedentary and non-sedentary populations. I received additional internal funding to lead work supporting the advancement of the methods used to assess mechanical loading during physical activity and production of novel software to accommodate the process. Publications and software dissemination plans related to this work are currently in progress.\n\nMy current work with neurological populations focuses on turning gait in people with Parkinson’s disease (internally funded) and the development of a novel device and software to quantify a functional clinical test used in the assessment of Parkinson’s disease. I have also recently contributed to the European funded project, MinD - Designing for People with Dementia: designing for mindful self-empowerment and social engagement, as an experienced researcher.\n\nAdditional themes that run through my research are using 3-D modelling to include analysis of the biomechanics of trunk and hip motion. I am currently responsible for the implementation and strategic development of the University of Wolverhampton’s new 3-D motion capture system, including developing collaborations across research teams.\n\nI have been a member of an expert working party for Macmilian Cancer Support, writing physical activity guidelines for healthcare professionals working with people with metastatic bone disease. I have published in peer reviewed academic journals and presented work at international conferences, such as the Congress of the International Society of Biomechanics and World Congress of Biomechanics. I regularly review articles for a range of international academic journals.\n\nI am also interested in the development of e-learning provision in biomechanics. I have a Post Graduate Certificate of Education (Post Compulsory Education and Training), a Certificate of Learning and Teaching in Higher Education, and I am a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy. I have previously been awarded funding by the Higher Education Academy UK Centre for Biosciences to enhance teaching methods used within the physical sciences in Higher Education.\n\nI am an activity member of the Sport and Physical Activity Research Centre (SPARC) at the University of Wolverhampton. I contribute to the research profile of SPARC, I am the Post Graduate Research Student Tutor, and held designated roles contributing to the development of the 2021 REF submission. I am also a member of the Department of Sport AthenaSWAN committee, which recently received the Departmental AthenaSwan Bronze Award, a member of the Policy Engagement at the University of Wolverhampton Group, and various groups involved in the development and commercialisation of rehabilitation services at the University of Wolverhampton.",

She has a long history of excellence in working with companies and liaising industry and academia to carry out cross-disciplinary research, particularly in the area of particle technology covering a range of applications from food structure and health, nutraceutical stability, controlled delivery of agrochemicals, oral care agents to energy storage. Having worked at the academic-industrial interface for many years, studied Biochemistry, Food science/processing and Engineering before settling on Chemical Engineering, she is fascinated about using a multi-disciplinary approach to problem-solving and to serve a broad range of industries.\nPrior to joining the University of Wolverhampton, she was a Research Fellow at the School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham, where she carried out different projects mainly in the areas of encapsulation and formulation engineering for application in foods, cosmetics, agrochemicals and energy, whilst also involved in teaching, including Encapsulation and Molecular Delivery, Food Manufacture & Technology, Enhancement of Chemical Engineering Teaching Labs and worked as Staff-Student Liaison and Outreach Officer.\nFideline's diverse backgrounds and exposure to different cultures, working and teaching styles enable a multifaceted approach to research and teaching. She has been involved in a broad range of consultancy works for multinational and national companies such as Nestle, PepsiCo, Philips Oral Care and Pangaea Agrochemicals., and much more.\nFideline initially graduated as a biochemist with a BSc in 1999 and a Master's degree in Biochemistry with a major in Nutrition and Food Technology in 2001 at the University of Douala Cameroon. This Master was completed while working as a Quality Control Assistant at Camlait (Cameroon market leader in dairy products) where she joined in 1998 just before completing her BSc. She then occupied various roles within the company working in Production and Marketing department before Joining the Laboratory of Food Science and Metabolism (University of Yaoundé) as a Research Associate where she liaised CamLait and the University and worked towards understanding consumers drive for soy milk-based products and contributed to the improvement of nutritional and sensorial quality of these products.\nIn 2003 she undertook a three- year joint degree in Food Science/processing and engineering at AGROPARITECH (former ENSIA-SIARC, France). During that time, she worked for CIRAD (France) where, as part of a £4 million DURAS project (Promoting Sustainable Development in Agricultural Research Systems), she optimised the malting processes and identified millet and sorghum species which generated malts that meet specifications for either beer or nutritious weaning food production.\nFideline then decided to take a PhD at the interface of biochemical and chemical engineering at the University of Birmingham in 2008. Her PhD was funded by BBSRC and aimed at reducing fat content and the risk of obesity while maintaining eating pleasure using microbubbles. This involved fermentation and extraction of hydrophobin protein from submerged fungi culture by foam fractionation, combining liquid-liquid and gas-liquid systems to develop a novel air-filled triphasic emulsion-based products and their characterisation in terms of microstructure, rheological and tribological behaviour, physical and oxidation stability.",

It can be applied to tweets, YouTube comments, other social media posts, or any other large sets of fairly short texts. \n\nWATA is a mixed method: starting with automatic processing using the free software Mozdeh to identify words that occur in a higher proportion of texts in one subset than another (e.g., male vs. female vs. nonbinary -authored; older vs. newer texts, highly retweeted vs. not retweeted texts), followed by human analysis for word contextualisation and to generate themes from the results. The final result is a set of themes occurring more in one set of texts than another.\n\nThis talk gives a brief introduction to Word Association Thematic Analysis. A detailed explanation and lots of examples can be found in the following book.\n\nThelwall, M. (2021). Word association thematic analysis: A social media text exploration strategy.

     "overview":"I am an advocate for animals and I work as a Reader (Associate Professor) in Animal Behaviour at University of Wolverhampton, where I also serve as the Faculty rep on the University Research Concordat Sub-committee and the University Ethics Sub-committee’s Working Group on Animal Research. \n\nI am currently the Principal Investigator of the EU-funded projects 'International Zoo Conservation & Management' (Erasmus+ Key Action 203 Mobility Project 2019-2022) and 'The Enriched Primate' (Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions 2020-2022). I am also a Co-Investigator of the UK-funded project 'Do Hunter-Gatherers have a Special Sense of Smell?' (British Academy/Leverhulme Trust – SRG).\n\nIn 2003 I graduated with first class honours in Biology (Behavioural Neurobiology) at Pisa University (Italy). Following a career break, I gained my PhD in Anthropology (Primatology) from Florence University (Italy) in 2009. After that, I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow on non-human primate and human behaviour in Florence, and as a Research Scientist on primate welfare and conservation at Garda Zoological Park (Italy). In 2013 I moved to Durham University as a Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellow in Anthropology focusing on my project 'Microsmatic Primates Revisited - Determining the Importance of Olfaction in Primate Communication' under the supervision of Professor Jo Setchell. I joined full-time Wolverhampton as a Lecturer in Animal Behaviour in 2016, while I continued my research work in collaboration with the Primatology Group at Durham University as an Honorary Research Fellow.\n\nI serve as an Editorial Board Member for Frontiers of Bioscience-Landmark and the Journal of Zoological and Botanical Gardens, and as an ad-hoc reviewer for several peer-reviewed international journals and funding agencies. Additionally, I am a Research Associate at Garda Zoological Park's ARCA Foundation (Italy), and an Advisory Member of the Board of Directors at NGOs École Nature Recherche (France) and Trunks & Leaves (US & Sri Lanka). Furthermore, for several years I have been working on applied projects about primate conservation and the sustainability of local communities in Africa and, as a result of this experience, in 2011 I co-founded a specialized consultancy firm, CarbonSinkGroup (Florence University's spin-off).\n\nI enjoy public engagement, including live interviews on camera (Sky News, BBC Persian Television) and press interviews for newspapers (Huffington Post, Informatore Coop, Travel News) to comment on animal-related stories. My research work has also attracted some media attention, including that of London-based TV production companies Blink Films, Oxford Scientific Films and Kalel Productions. In particular, Blink Films made a series all about animal communication (‘Animals Decoded’), with an episode (‘Invisible Communication’) entirely focused on my work on primate chemical communication, which aired on Love Nature (Canada) and The Smithsonian Channel (US) in 2019.",

     "overview":"Professor Wang has over 35 years experience in clinical and fundamental/translational cancer research. At the early age of his career, he mainly focused on cancer clinical practice and clinical related cancer research. Invited by Professor Sir Michael Dexter, he joined the Department of Experimental Haematology in Paterson Institute for Cancer Research in Manchester, UK in 1992 and obtained his PhD in Molecular Oncology at Manchester Metropolitan University. Since 1999, his research was mainly focused on identification of genetic elements responsible for cancer drug resistance and discovery of new genetic targets for development of novel anti-cancer drugs, especially repositioning of non-anticancer drugs into cancer treatment. His team demonstrated NF-κB is involved in cancer cell stemness and chemoresistance. He identified Disulfiram, an antialcoholism drug, to block NF-κB pathway and reversing cancer cell chemoresistance. He first demonstrated that the very short half-life of Disulfiram (< 1min) was the bottleneck limiting clinical translation of it into cancer therapeutics. His team used nano-drug-delivery system to extend the half-life of Disulfiram and achieved promising outcomes. This novel idea led to filing of a couple of patents. Based on these IPRs and supported by University of Wolverhampton and external investor, the University set up a spin-out company, Disulfican Ltd, to further develop the new formulation of Disulfiram and it derivative into cancer treatment. Professor Wang's work is very broadly involved in breast, lung, liver, colon, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, leukaemia and mesothelioma. He has collaborated widely with colleagues in the UK, China, Europe and USA.",

She writes about theatre history with a particular focus in uncovering the work that under-represented and minoritised groups do, and have done, in the arts. She is passionate about widening participation in theatre and in education, and in making research engaging and accessible.  \n\nAs a dramaturg she has collaborated and advised on a range of projects from site-specific immersive theatre to West End musicals. Her PhD thesis proposed a cultural materialist approach in revealing collaborative practices in music theatre, and consequently challenging established historiographies; she focuses particularly on the work of Kurt Weill. She has published widely in the field of musical theatre studies, and has spoken to a variety of audiences about the musical as a form.\n\nShe has significant experience in curriculum design and delivery across drama and performing arts courses.",

I work on development of novel biologics derived from therapeutic cell secretome components including microvesicles (e.g. exosomes), soluble proteins and metabolites. The research is based on evidence demonstrating that skeletal muscle conditioned medium (CM: secretome), i.e. secreted proteins and exosomes, (membrane bound proteins and RNA) significantly reduces chondrocyte inflammation, a major marker for osteoarthritis (OA). Therapy for OA is primarily focused on symptom control. In 2019, over 8.75 million people aged ≥45 years sought treatment for OA in the UK.  Costs for treating OA and rheumatoid arthritis will reach £118.6 billion by 2029. This 6-month pilot study will allow discovery of cell secretome formulations that significantly reduce chondrocyte dysfunction, a major pathological feature of OA. The research strategy will introduce novel secretome biotherapeutics that diminish chondrocyte inflammation and enhance cartilage matrix production, using cutting-edge knowledge in bioprocessing and industrial analytics.",
